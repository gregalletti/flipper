# flipper
Pinball game in WebGL 2.0 for the Computer Graphics course @PoliMI

## The track
> Design a flipper game. You can approximate the paddles as a parallelepiped. You have to
implement the physics of the ball paying attention to the collisions. You can implement
simple “physics” rules (i.e., the ball and the paddles cannot go outside the playing table, the
velocity is constant)
