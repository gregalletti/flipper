# Pinball
Pinball game in WebGL 2.0 for the [Computer Graphics][computer-graphics] course A.Y 2019/2020 at [Politecnico di Milano][polimi] <br/>


## Overview
> Design and implementation of a pinball game. The game inspired is inspired to Super Mario. <br/>

## Game Design
> The idea of the game is to score as many points as possible hitting the obstacles and avoiding the ball from falling down. <br/>
There is a Magic Cube that gives either an additional life point or a bonus ball. <br/>
An easter egg is waiting for you.. :stuck_out_tongue_closed_eyes:
## Graphics Design
> All the assets have been created and edited with [Blender][blender] <br/>
Every part of the interactable world has been approximated to a geometrical figure:
- ball = sphere
- paddles = parallelepipeds
- slingshots = triangles
- bumpers = spheres
- walls = lines 
- coins = circles
- pipe = cylinder
## Physics
We have implemented a basic collision detection mechanism applying the rules of Analytical Mechanics.
